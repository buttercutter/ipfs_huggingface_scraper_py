# Test Summary

## Components Tested

1. **State Manager**
   - Basic functionality for tracking model processing
   - Marking models as processed, completed, and errored
   - Pausing and resuming operations
   - State persistence

2. **Rate Limiter**
   - Initialization and configuration
   - Setting and getting rate limits
   - Authentication status

3. **Configuration System**
   - Default configuration values
   - Getting and setting configuration values

4. **IPFS Integration**
   - Initialization with and without IPFS
   - Availability checking
   - File operations with mocked IPFS objects
   - Adding files to IPFS
   - Pinning content

5. **CLI**
   - Module structure validation

## Test Results

All tests are now passing, confirming that the core functionality of the implemented components is working as expected.

## Next Steps for Testing

1. **Enhanced Scraper Tests**
   - Test model discovery
   - Test batch processing
   - Test resumable operations
   - Test integration with other components

2. **Integration Tests**
   - End-to-end tests with mock HuggingFace API
   - Test full scraping pipeline

3. **Error Handling Tests**
   - Test recovery from network errors
   - Test handling of API rate limits
   - Test resumption from interrupted operations

4. **Distributed Scraping Tests**
   - Test coordinator-worker architecture
   - Test synchronization between scrapers

## Test Coverage

Current test coverage is focused on the core components and their basic functionality. To improve test coverage:

1. Add pytest-cov to track code coverage
2. Expand tests to cover edge cases and error paths
3. Add more test fixtures for different scenarios
4. Implement API mocking for HuggingFace tests
