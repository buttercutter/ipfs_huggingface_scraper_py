## Test Coverage

Current test coverage is focused on the core components and their basic functionality. To improve test coverage:

1. Add pytest-cov to track code coverage
2. Expand tests to cover edge cases and error paths
3. Add more test fixtures for different scenarios
4. Implement API mocking for HuggingFace tests
5. Test multi-entity concurrent scraping
6. Test provenance tracking with real-world model and dataset relationships
